      "\n",
      "Currently, there are two output formats implemented:\n",
      "\n",
      " * `stream`: the resulting backup image is saved in a streamlined format,\n",
      "   where the backup file consists of metadata about offsets and lengths\n",
      "   of zeroed or allocated contents of the virtual machines disk. This is\n",
      "   the default. The resulting backup image is thin provisioned.\n",
      " * `raw`: The resulting backup image will be a full provisioned raw image,\n",
      "   this should mostly be used for debugging any problems with the extent\n",
      "   handler, it won't work with incremental backups.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Extents\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to save only used data from the images, dirty blocks are queried from\n",
      "the NBD server. The behavior can be changed by using the option `-q` to use\n",
      "common qemu tools (nbdinfo). By default `virtnbdbackup` uses a custom\n",
      "implemented extent handler.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Backup I/O and performance: scratch files\n",
      "\n",
      "If virtual domains handle heavy I/O load during backup (such as writing or\n",
      "deleting lots of data while the backup is active) you might consider using the\n",
      "`--scratchdir` option to change the default scratch file location.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the backup operation qemu will use the created scratch files for\n",
      "fleecing, thus it is recommended to store these files on storage that meets the\n",
      "same I/O performance requirements as the backup target.\n",
      "\n",
      "The free space on the default scratch directory (`/var/tmp`) must be enough to\n",

      "To get more detailed debug output use `--verbose` option. To enable NBD\n",

      "will be at least as big as the used data within the virtual machine. \n",
      "\n",
      "You can use the `--compress` option or other tools to compress the backup\n",

      "\n",
      "This inconsistency can be caused by several situations:\n",
      "\n",

      " 2) A change to the libvirt environment between backups (such as re-installing\n",
      "    the libvirt daemon) caused the system to lose track of the existing\n",
      "    checkpoints, but the bitmaps are still existent in the disk files.\n",
      " 3) Between backups, the disk image contents were reset and now the image has\n",
      "    already defined bitmaps (if disk was restored from a storage snapshot, for\n",
      "    example )\n",
      " 4) `virtnbdbackup` is started on an backup target directory with an old state\n",
      "    and starts from a wrong checkpoint count, now attempting to create an\n",
      "    checkpoint whose bitmap already exists (might happen if you rotate backup\n",
